## Code Challenge

For the function that removes all instances of a specified topping. I have no choice to go through the array. I can't let one element of the array because it can be the one I want to remove. Since the function "filter" in O(n), then, in all cases my function will be in big Theta(n).

At first, for the second function I tried, to do the same thing that the first function. I tried to remove the element that I have in double in the array. But I used the function indexOf in the function filter, so my function was in O(n^2). Then I thought if I sort every element of my array, use slice(0) and a function filter that compare my first element and my second element. I have a function that is in theta(nlogn) . So my second function is quicker than my first.

Bonus: I decided to use a small function that display my array in html list and add a little of CSS to make it better.
